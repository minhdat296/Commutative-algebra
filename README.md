# Foundations of geometric representation theory

In this project, we attempt to collect the background algebraic and geometric materials needed for modern geometric representation theory (e.g. the geometric Langlands programmes), such as (derived) algebraic geometry, rigid-analytic geometry and p-adic Hodge theory, and D-modules and representations of algebraic groups, etc. The project has grown to quite a large size and as such is being slowly split into smaller sub-projects for manageability and better quality-control, which later on will be compiled back together into a book.
