# Commutative Algebra

In this project, we attempt to reformulate various notions from classical commutative algebra (such as flatness, regularity, smoothness, etc.) in an entirely categorical manner, so as to be able to later write down their analogues in derived algebraic geometry without having to develop extra theory. We will also be presenting certain applications, such as deformation theory, the theory of D-modules, and certain motivic/geometric aspects of p-adic Hodge theory.
