    \section{Pro-\'etale cohomology for schemes: "Another fine cohomology theory to add to my collection"}
        Despite its successes - particularly its involvement in the proofs of the Weil Conjectures - \'etale cohomology has its shortcomings. For one, \'etale cohomology modules are not actually computed over \'etale sites, but rather, as scalar extensions (to $\overline{\Q_{\ell}}$ in the case of $\ell$-adic cohomology for instance) of the actually \'etale cohomology modules over \'etale sites. Pro-\'etale cohomology theories exist so that such issues could be rectified. 
        
        \begin{remark}[What is the pro-\'etale topology ?]
            For now, we refer the reader to \cite[Definition 4.1.1 and Remark 4.1.3]{bhatt_scholze_2014_pro_etale}.
