\chapter{Crystals and arithmetic differential geometry} \label{chapter: crystals}
    \begin{abstract}
        In this chapter, we introduce firstly the notion of divided power algebras over general commutative rings (also know in French circles as pd-algebras, with \say{pd} standing for \say{puissances-divis\'ees}), which shall subsequently be employed in discussions regarding topics, notable among which is crystalline cohomology, a sort of analogue of the theory of vector bundles with flat connections in prime characteristics. These machineries play fundamental roles in the construction of crystalline cohomology, an arithmetic analogue of de Rham cohomology.
