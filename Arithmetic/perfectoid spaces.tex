                \paragraph{Almost modules}
                    To be able to understand the consequences of perfectoid fields being deeply ramified, we will be needing the language of almost-ring theory. Our main reference shall be \cite[Chapter 14]{gabber_ramero_almost_ring_theory}.
                    
                    \begin{convention}[\say{Basic setups}] \label{conv: basic_setups}
                        A \textbf{basic setup} for us shall always be a pair $(\scrV, \m)$ consisting of a commutative ring $\scrV$ along with an idempotent ideal $\m$ (i.e. one such that $\m^2 = \m$; note that this ideal need not be maximal, despite what our notation might suggest). One often speaks also of \textbf{flat basic setups}, which are basic setups $(\scrV, \m)$ such that $\m$ is flat over $\scrV$; such a specification can be made to ensure that the functor $- \tensor_{\scrV} \m$ is exact.
                    \end{convention}
                    
                    \begin{definition}[Almost-zero modules] \label{def: almost_zero_modules}
                        Let $(\scrV, \m)$ be a basic setup (cf. convention \ref{conv: basic_setups}) and fix a $\scrV$-algebra. Then, a $\scrV$-module $M$ (or should the situation calls for speification, a $(\scrV, \m)$-module $M$) is said to be \textbf{almost-zero} if and only if it is annihilated by $\m$, i.e.:
                            $$\m M = 0$$
                    \end{definition}
                    \begin{lemma} \label{lemma: tensor_powers_of_flat_modules}
                        Let $R$ be a commutative ring and let $N$ be a flat $R$-module. Then, $N \tensor_R N$ is also flat. Also, for all $R$-ideals $\m$, one has:
                            $$\m \tensor_R M \cong \m M$$
                    \end{lemma}
                        \begin{proof}
                            If $N$ is flat over $R$ then the functor $- \tensor_R N$ will be left-exact. The composition of two left-exact is again left-exact for trivial reasons. Thus $N \tensor_R N$ is flat over $R$.
                            
                            As for the assertion that $\m \tensor_R M \cong \m M$ whenever $\m$ is flat, we can rely on homological algebra. Specifically, because $\m$ is flat, we have:
                                $$\m M \cong \Tor_R^1(\m, M) \cong 0$$
                        \end{proof}
                    \begin{proposition}[Another definition of almost-zero modules] \label{prop: almost_zero_module_alt_def}
                        Let $(\scrV, \m)$ be a \textit{flat} basic setup (cf. convention \ref{conv: basic_setups}) and fix a $\scrV$-algebra. Then, a $\scrV$-module $M$ is said to be \textbf{almost-zero} if and only if:
                            $$\m \tensor_{\scrV} M  \cong0$$
                    \end{proposition}
                        \begin{proof}
                            \noindent
                            \begin{enumerate}
                                \item Suppose first of all that $M$ is \textit{non-zero} and almost-zero, i.e. that $\m M \cong 0$. Then, a direct application of lemma \ref{lemma: tensor_powers_of_flat_modules} (which is appropriate because $\m$ is flat over $\scrV$) tells us that:
                                    $$0 \cong \m M \cong \m \tensor_{\scrV} M$$
                                \item Conversely, suppose that $\m \tensor_{\scrV} M \cong 0$. Because $\m$ is flat over $\scrV$, this tells us that there exists the following short exact sequence:
                                    $$0 \to \m \tensor_{\scrV} \m M \to 0 \to M/\m M \tensor_{\scrV} \m \to 0$$
                                Using some abstract nonsense, we can then see that:
                                    $$\m \tensor_{\scrV} \m M \cong 0$$
                                We can apply the flatness assumption on $\m$ again, which gives:
                                    $$0 \cong \m \tensor_{\scrV} \m M \cong (\m \tensor_{\scrV} \m) M \cong \m^2 M$$
                                Lastly, because $\m$ is idempotent, the above implies that:
                                    $$0 \cong \m^2 M = \m M$$
                                i.e. $M$ is almost-zero as a $\scrV$-module.
                            \end{enumerate}
                        \end{proof}
                        
                    \begin{proposition}[Thick subcategories of almost-zero modules] \label{prop: thick_subcategories_of_almost_zero_modules}
                        Let $(\scrV, \m)$ be a flat basic setup. Then, almost-zero $\scrV$-modules form a thick subcategory of $\scrV\mod$, which we shall denote by $(\scrV, \m)\mod^0$.
                    \end{proposition}
                        \begin{proof}
                            \noindent
                            \begin{enumerate}
                                \item \textbf{(Full subcategories of almost-zero modules):} Let $M, N$ be two almost-zero $(\scrV, \m)$-modules. Then, because:
                                    $$\m M \cong \m N \cong 0$$
                                we have:
                                    $$M \cong M/\m M, N \cong N/\m N$$
                                and so any diagram of the following form, wherein the rows are short exact sequences, would commute:

                                    $$
                                From this, we can infer that morphisms of almost-zero module are just module homomorphisms, which means that there exists a full subcategory $(\scrV, \m)\mod^0$ of $\scrV\mod$ spanned by almost-zero $(\scrV, \m)$-modules.
                                \item \textbf{(Thickness):} A \textit{full} subcategory $\S$ of a triangulated category $\T$ (cf. definition \ref{def: triangulated_infinity_categories}; our triangulated category is $\scrV\mod$) is said to be \textbf{thick} whenever it is closed under extensions, which is to say, for all short exact sequences:
                                    $$0 \to M' \to M \to M'' \to 0$$
                                should $M$ be an object of $\S$, then so must $M'$ and $M''$ too, and vice versa (one might also think of a thick subcategory as the homotopy category of a stable full $\infty$-subcategory of a triangulated $\infty$-category; cf. remark \ref{remark: elementary_properties_of_triangulated_categories}). We already have fullness, so it remains to show that $(\scrV, \m)\mod^0$ is closed under extensions. To this end, consider a short exact sequence of $\scrV$-modules, such as the following:
                                    $$0 \to M' \to M \to M'' \to 0$$
                                wherein $M$ is almost-zero. Then, because binary direct sums of modules are biproducts and because $\m$ is flat over $\scrV$, one can construct the following diagram with short exact rows out of the short exact sequence above:
                                    $$

                    \begin{remark}[Almost-zero modules over non-flat basic setups] \label{remark: almost_zero_modules_over_non_flat_basic_setups}
                        \noindent
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item \textbf{(Removing the flatness assumption):} Proposition \ref{prop: thick_subcategories_of_almost_zero_modules} allows us to pull off quite a stunt, and for that matter, not even with much difficulty: the flatness assumption on $\m$ can be completely removed! Of course, the trade-off is that now, only the $\infty$-categorical version of proposition \ref{prop: thick_subcategories_of_almost_zero_modules} would hold: via the Dold-Kan Correspondence, one has that for $(\scrV, \m)$ a basic setup, $\scrV$-modules annihilated by $\m$ span a stable full $\infty$-subcategory $(\scrV, \m)\mod^0$ (or perhaps ${}^{\leq 0}_{(\scrV, \m)}\mod^0$) of the triangulated $\infty$-category ${}^{\leq 0}_{\scrV}\mod$ of projective resolutions of $\scrV$-modules. This descends naturally down to the level of derived categories. One can thus generalise proposition \ref{prop: almost_zero_module_alt_def} too: a $\scrV$-module is almost-zero if and only if:
                                $$\m \tensor_{\scrV}^{\L} M \cong_{\qis} 0$$
                            (i.e. the chain complex $\Tor_{\scrV}^*(\m, M)$ is homotopic to $0$).
                            \item \textbf{(Abelian categories of almost-zero modules):} If we extract the hearts of the t-structures out of ${}^{\leq 0}_{(\scrV, \m)}\mod^0$ and ${}^{\leq 0}_{\scrV}\mod$, we will be able to establish ${}^{\leq 0}_{(\scrV, \m)}\mod^{\almost, \heart}$ as a Serre subcategory of ${}^{\leq 0}_{\scrV}\mod^{\heart}$, and since hearts of t-structure are spanned by objects concentrated in degree $0$, one can furthurmore recognise ${}^{\leq 0}_{(\scrV, \m)}\mod^0$ as a Serre subcategory of $\scrV\mod$ whenever the basic setup $(\scrV, \m)$ is \textit{flat}. In particular, we have that the thick subcategories of almost-zero modules are \textit{abelian}.
                        \end{itemize}

                        (i.e. the category spanned by objects of the form $\m \tensor_{\scrV}^{\L} M$, where $M$ is a $\scrV$-module) shall be called the category of \textbf{almost modules}. We shall denote this category by ${(\scrV, \m)}^{\leq 0}\mod^{\almost}$.

                        It is not hard to see that for $(\scrV, \m)$ a basic setup, the category ${(\scrV, \m)}^{\leq 0}\mod^0$ of almost-zero $(\scrV, \m)$-modules is the kernel or the essentially surjective functor:
                            $$\m \tensor_{\scrV}^{\L} -: {\scrV}^{\leq 0}\mod \to {(\scrV, \m)}^{\leq 0}\mod^{\almost}$$
                        Note that this kernel is well-defined because $\m \tensor_{\scrV}^{\L} -$ is an idempotent functor (cf. remark \ref{remark: almost_zero_modules_over_non_flat_basic_setups}).

                        Let $(\scrV, \m)$ be a basic setup (which need not be flat). Then, the tensor-hom adjunction establishes ${(\scrV, \m)}^{\leq 0}\mod^{\almost}$ as a localisation. This is to say, there exists the following $\infty$-adjunction:
                            $$

                        \begin{proof}
                            The only thing to prove here is that $j_*$ ought to be fully faithful, which we can do via showing that the counit of the adjunction is naturally isomorphic to the identity; explicitly, this means showing that for all almost-zero $(\scrV, \m)$-modules $M$, one has the following isomorphism:
                                $$j^* j_* M \cong M$$
                            However, this is an automatic consequence of the fact that ${(\scrV, \m)}^{\leq 0}\mod^{\almost}$ is the essential image of $j^*: {\scrV}^{\leq}\mod \to {\scrV}^{\leq}\mod$.

                        wherein $j^* \cong \m \tensor_{\scrV}^{\L} -$ and $j_*(-) \cong \R\Hom_{\scrV}(\m, -)$.
                    \end{theorem}
                        \begin{proof}
                            We have already been provided with the middle adjunction $j^* \ladjoint j_*$, so let us just prove that the $!$-pushforwards and $!$-pullbacks exist and fit into the following adjunctions:
                                $$j_! \ladjoint j^*$$
                                $$j_* \ladjoint j^!$$
                            Although, we should note that we can have $j^* \cong \m \tensor_{\scrV}^{\L} -$ and $j_*(-) \cong \R\Hom_{\scrV}(\m, -)$ as two of the basic \href{https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/six+operations}{\underline{four operations}} because ${(\scrV, \m)}^{\leq 0}\mod^{\almost}$ is the essential image of a functor out of ${\scrV}^{\leq 0}\mod$ (cf. proposition \ref{prop: localising_at_almost_modules}). 
                                \begin{enumerate}
                                    \item \textbf{($!$-pushforward):} To show that the further left-adjoint $j^!$ exists, we will be using Lurie's Adjoint Functor Theorem \cite[Corollary 5.5.2.9]{HTT}, which states that should $\C$ and $\D$ be presentable $\infty$-categories and $R: \C \to \D$ be a functor between them, then there exists an adjunction $L \ladjoint R$ if and only if $R$ is accessible (i.e. $R$ preserves all filtered colimits) and left-exact. For this, we will first need to show that ${(\scrV, \m)}^{\leq 0}\mod^{\almost}$ is a presentable $\infty$-category (it is well-known that module categories like ${\scrV}^{\leq 0}\mod$ are presentable, so we will not be providing a proof).
                                        \begin{enumerate}
                                            \item \textbf{(${(\scrV, \m)}^{\leq 0}\mod^{\almost}$ is presentable):} Recall that a presentable stable $\infty$-category is the same as an $\infty$-category that is:
                                                \begin{itemize}
                                                    \item accessible (cf. proposition \ref{prop: accessible_stable_infinity_categories}; accessible $\infty$-category is simply one that is its own ind-completion) and
                                                    \item equivalent to a left-exact localisation (i.e a left-exact functor with a full faithful right-adjoint) of a stable $\infty$-category.
                                                \end{itemize}  
                                                
                                            The second condition is an automatic consequence of proposition \ref{prop: localising_at_almost_modules} and the assumption that $\m$ is flat (which means, by definition, that $j^*(-) \cong \m \tensor_{\scrV} -$ is a left-exact functor), and so it remains to prove the first      condition. 
                                            
                                            For this, consider a filtered colimit:
                                                $$\underset{i \in I}{\colim} (\m \tensor_{\scrV}^{\L} M_i)$$
                                            of almost $(\scrV, \m)$-modules $\m \tensor_{\scrV}^{\L} M_i$ (see proposition \ref{prop: localising_at_almost_modules} for why almost modules are of this form). We can then apply the fact that $\m \tensor_{\scrV}^{\L} -$ commutes with all colimits to get:
                                                $$\m \tensor_{\scrV}^{\L} \underset{i \in I}{\colim} (\m \tensor_{\scrV}^{\L} M_i) \cong \m \tensor_{\scrV}^{\L} \underset{i \in I}{\colim} M_i$$
                                            Because ${\scrV}^{\leq 0}\mod$ is a cocomplete category (which implies, in particular, that $\underset{i \in I}{\colim} M_i$ is a $\scrV$-module), this tells us that ${(\scrV, \m)}^{\leq 0}\mod^{\almost}$ is closed under filtered colimits. 
                                            
                                            The category ${(\scrV, \m)}^{\leq 0}\mod^{\almost}$ is thus accessible by definition, and we have therefore shown that ${(\scrV, \m)}^{\leq 0}\mod^{\almost}$ is presentable as an $\infty$-category.
                                            \item \textbf{($j^*$ is accessible):} Because tensor products commute with all colimits, $j^*$ is trivially accessible by virtue of being naturally isomorphic to $\m \tensor_{\scrV}^{\L} -$. 
                                            \item \textbf{($j^*$ is left-exact):} This is an automatic consequence of the flatness assumption on $\m$.
                                        \end{enumerate}
                                    \item \textbf{($!$-pullback):} We have already shown that ${(\scrV, \m)}^{\leq 0}\mod^{\almost}$ is a presentable $\infty$-category, so we can apply Lurie's Adjoint Functor Theorem again, which tells us that we will only need to show that $j_*$ is right-exact. However, because corepresentable functors preserve colimits \textit{a priori} (cf. \cite{nlab:hom-functor_preserves_limits}), the functor:
                                        $$j_* \cong \R\Hom_{\scrV}(\m, -)$$
                                    is trivially right-exact.
                                \end{enumerate}
                        \end{proof}

                        Let $(\scrV, \m)$ be a basic setup. Then, ${(\scrV, \m)}^{\leq 0}\mod^{\almost}$ is a rigid monoidal category; in particular, there is a compatibility of tensor products in the following manner for all $\scrV$-modules $M$ and $N$:
                            $$j^*M \tensor^{\L}_{\scrV} j^*N \cong j^*(M \tensor^{\L}_{\scrV} N)$$
                        where $j^*$ is as in proposition \ref{prop: localising_at_almost_modules} and theorem \ref{theorem: four_functors_for_almost_modules}; the monoidal unit is $\m$.

                            $$j^*M \tensor^{\L}_{\scrV} j^*N \cong j^*(M \tensor^{\L}_{\scrV} N)$$
                        by:
                            $$M^{\almost} \tensor^{\L}_{\scrV} N^{\almost} \cong (M \tensor^{\L}_{\scrV} N)^{\almost}$$
                        whenever the underlying basic setup $(\scrV, \m)$ is understood.

                        Let $(\scrV, \m)$ be a basic setup, which is possible non-flat.
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item \textbf{(Tensor products of almost modules):} ${\scrV}^{\leq 0}\mod$ does \textit{not} admit ${(\scrV, \m)}^{\leq 0}\mod^{\almost}$ as a \textit{monoidal} subcategory, as the monoidal structures thereon are formed differently; in particular, their monoidal units ($\scrV$ and $\m$ respectively) do not coincide.
                            \item \textbf{(Tensor products of almost-zero modules):} The story is not quite the same for almost-zero modules, which form a subcategory of ${\scrV}^{\leq 0}\mod$. Thanks to the assumption that $\m$ is idempotent (in the sense that $\m \tensor_{\scrV}^{\L} \m \cong \m$; cf. convention \ref{conv: basic_setups} and remark \ref{remark: almost_zero_modules_over_non_flat_basic_setups}), one has the following for all almost-zero modules $M, N$:
                                $$\m \tensor_{\scrV}^{\L} (M \tensor_{\scrV}^{\L} N) \cong (\m \tensor_{\scrV}^{\L} \m) \tensor_{\scrV}^{\L} (M \tensor_{\scrV}^{\L} N) \cong (\m \tensor_{\scrV}^{\L} M) \tensor_{\scrV}^{\L} (\m \tensor_{\scrV}^{\L} N) = 0 \tensor_{\scrV}^{\L} 0 \cong 0$$
                            which proves that ${(\scrV, \m)}^{\leq 0}\mod^0$ is a monoidal subcategory of ${\scrV}^{\leq 0}\mod$.

            \subsubsection{Perfectoid fields and rings}
                We begin by introducing the notion of perfectoid rings and affinoid perfectoid (pre)adic spaces.
            
                \begin{definition}[Perfectoid fields and perfectoid algebras over them] \label{def: perfectoid_fields}
                    A \textit{complete} Tate ring $R$ is \textbf{perfectoid} if and only if:
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item \textbf{(Uniformity):} The subring of topologically bounded elements $R^{\circ}$ is itself bounded (in the sense that for all open neighbourhoods $U$ of $0$, there exist another open neighbourhood $V$ of $0$ such that $VR^{\circ} \subseteq U$), and 
                            \item \textbf{(Surjectivity of Frobenius):} There exists a pseudo-uniformiser $\varphi \in R^{\circ \circ}$ such that $\varphi^p \mid p$ and that the Frobenius on $R^{\circ}/\varphi$ is \textit{surjective}.
                        \end{itemize}
                \end{definition}
                \begin{remark}[Perfectoid fields contain all $p$-power roots] \label{remark: perfectoid_fields_have_p_power_roots}
                    The requirement that residual Frobenii are surjective is an especially important one for perfectoid spaces. There is a myriad of facts that it implies, but they are all further consequences of one: that perfectoid fields contain lots of $p^{th}$ power roots. Interestingly, this is a straightforward consequence of the definition of surjectivity, which tells us that for all perfectoid fields $K$, one has:
                        $$\forall x \in K^{\circ}/p: \exists y \in K^{\circ}/p: y^p = x$$
                    which is the same as:
                        $$\forall x \in K^{\circ}/p: \exists y \in K^{\circ}/p: y = x^{\frac1p}$$
                    and from this one gets the existence of roots of higher powers $x^{\frac{1}{p^n}}$. 
                    
                    This detail will be very important when we try to construct examples of perfectoid fields, as well as in lemma \ref{lemma: perfectoid_tilts_are_perfect} where we establish the fact that tilts of perfectoid fields are perfect (thereby justifying the name \say{perfectoid}).
                \end{remark}
                \begin{example}[Perfectoid rings and fields] \label{example: perfectoid_rings_and_fields}
                    Standard examples of perfectoid fields are the topological completions of $\Q_p(p^{1/p^{\infty}}), \Q_p(\mu_{p^{\infty}}), \Q_p^{\alg}$, and $\F_p(\!(t^{1/p^{\infty}})\!)$.
                \end{example}
                
                \begin{definition}[Tilts] \label{def: perfectoid_tilts}
                    Let $R$ be a perfectoid ring and let $\varpi \in R^{\circ \circ}$ be some pseudo-uniformiser. Then, first of all, one defines its multiplicative tilt $R^{\flat}$, where one takes the limit in the category of commutative monoids. Next, one gives $R^{\flat}$ the structure of a ring via:
                        $$R^{\flat} \cong (R^{\circ}/\varpi)^{\flat}[1/\varpi^{\flat}]$$
                \end{definition}
                \begin{example}
                    Different perfectoid fields can have isomorphic tilts, e.g. the tilts of both $\Q_p(p^{1/p^{\infty}})$ and $\Q_p(\mu_{p^{\infty}})$ are both isomorphic to $\F_p(\!(t^{1/p^{\infty}})\!)$. Later on, we will see that this gives rise to the moduli space of untilts (i.e. the Fargues-Fontaine Curve).
